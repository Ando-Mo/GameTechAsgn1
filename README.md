**My scene is of a heroine being snatched away from the hero and his floating island by a mysterious government agent in an old airplane.**

I included objects that allowed me to roughly insinuate the details of the location. For instance, there's a "grass" and "dirt" layer to the island, both of which are copies of the same object that have been modeled different colors. I included a lighthouse to fill up the space of the island, and flowers at the feet of the hero to make his loss seem more tragic. 

I was certainly inspired by the movie "Castle in the Sky." The movie is about a strapping young boy and a mysterious young princess who discover the secret of a mysterious floating city that has been lost to time. My favorite scene was always their arrival to the island- when they can silently take in the experiences before the government agents come to ransack the city and steal its secrets. 

The main character is the young boy on the island who is powerless to stop the kidnapping of his dear friend.

*List of each object in your scene:*
- Rusty red plane
- young anime girl
- sci-fi soldier 
- the shotgun on his back (which I modeled myself)
- young male
- flower 1
- flower 2 (both from the same low-poly flower asset pack)
- rock (the two rocks used to form the island)
- lighthouse (which I modeled myself)
